## Introduction

just a demo for me to learn more about LLMs with a friend

our end goal is potentially to put it on the app store? might be a little ambitious

current goal is to train an LLM from scratch to learn more about neural networks

## Instructions

First, you need to install the dependencies

You can install them using pip or create a conda environment
* `conda install -n [name] conda-forge::transformers datasets evaluate sacrebleu`
* `pip install transformers datasets evaluate sacrebleu`
